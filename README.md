# Legacy Elytras

A Legacy Fabric mod that backports elytras, fireworks, and all of their respective mechanics to 1.7 and 1.8.

## Elytras

There are two recipes for crafting the elytra:

With the goal in mind of making them a renewable end-game item. Elytras can be repaired using leather in an anvil.

Unfortunately, due to legacy fabric not supporting custom textures at the moment, the elytra uses a default texture. This may be fixed in a future update.

## Fireworks

Because fireworks were added in 1.4, the mod simply adds the flying functionality to them. They can still be obtained in the usual way, crafted with gunpowder and paper.
